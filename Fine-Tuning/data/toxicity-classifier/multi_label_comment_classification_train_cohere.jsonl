He added the additional data at the top of the page only in an act of revenge and to cover up the 'eternity clause' article. And again he focused on the word \"\"constition\"\" at the top of his changes. And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the \"\"entrenched clause\"\" and again was wrongfully pushing the word \"\"constitution\"\" (which Germany does not have), he then added \"\"Basic Law\"\" to his change. Then several editors suddently (for the first time) showed up and one of them deleted the entire 'eternity clause' article, leaving only what Lone boatman had put in.
